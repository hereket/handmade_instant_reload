# Introduction

This is just a exploration of how to rebuild android application on the fly, how
to mimic pc game on a mobile phone and other stuff.

The game code is heavily base on the video series of Casey Muratori where he
build a game from scratch. I just took the initial idea as good starting point.

You can check how the it looks on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci20qYt-w6o

There is an article that goes over about some ideas used in this project here: https://hereket.github.io/posts/instant_code_reload/

The code is bad and might be unstructered and will remain this way for some time
as the main reason is to explore different ideas and not do code management.
Once I get a grasp what how it should be I will tighten it.
